move listener stuff into Bug class
    don't: we can't serialize the listeners (since the view
    pulls in the gtk stuff)
    instead model should have a update_bug method which handles it
implement a check in the update_hash Bug method that checks for "status
changes"
what is a status change?
    bug is now done
    what else defines whether the bug has "changed"?
    should we delegate this to the view?
        if not <we still want to see this bug>:
            remove it
    use hash equality to check whether we should inform the listeners?
