hide_bug in gui.py has some logic in there to handle situations where
the bug is not being displayed (including when the list is empty). Should
it do this, or should the caller not call it if it is not displayed?

string stash
------------

this will work by

    adding a list of previously used next actions to our Model
        bumping the serialize_format
        saving the nextactions hash as the fourth tuple item
        if fmt of loaded in data is >= 4, set nextactions from fourth tuple
        item

secondly, the triage window must

    save submitted next actions to the nextactions hash
    check on each keystroke/field modification whether there's a completion
        we could apply
