debgtd

'debgtd' is a program that is design to help a user manage bugs that they are
working on.

Rationale: I try and track bugs in packages in Debian. I used to do this
purely by which I have submitted. This was not ideal, because

 * sometimes I am interested in a bug I did not submit
   * bugs against packages I maintain
   * bugs that I am suffering but didn't file first
   * bugs against packages I am otherwise interested in
 * I am not interested in all bugs that I have submitted
   * Some programs I no longer use

Once my list of open bugs hit about 100, I could no longer reliably track
which needed my attention and which did not. I therefore wrote debgtd.

The intention is to let you track an arbitrary set of bugs. At the moment, it
only imports those reported by you or against packages you are listed as a
maintainer for.

The intention is to let you selectively mark some of those bugs as to be
ignored. It does this.

You can also "sleep" a bug. We do this if a bug does not need our attention
right now, but will do in the future. This behaves the same as ignoring, for
now.

When should a bug wake up?

Either after some activity has taken place, or a given timeout.

What activities should count?

At the moment, nothing is woken up.

Other workflow
--------------

I want the tool to capture bug workflows and make it easier to track where
you are with them, e.g. the NMU workflow:

NMU procedural information:
http://www.debian.org/doc/developers-reference/ch-pkgs.en.html#s-nmu
    * file the bug
    * wait "a few days" for a response
    * submit a patch
    * wait "a few more days"
    * announce nmu intention
    * prepare nmu
    * upload to delayed queue
    * send final patch to bts, explain 7 day reaction

annotations
-----------

looking at my bug pile right now, I see some bugs that could use some
attention, perhaps to see if they still apply, etc.: I cant' do the actual
work now, but I could do with making a note of the identified "next action"
