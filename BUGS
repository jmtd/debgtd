we can't pickle the GTK stuff so need to only pickle/unpickle an internal
part of the Model class and not the list of listeners.

probably provide serialize methods in Model which pack/unpack the bugs
hash and use them in controller. this would have the advantage of not
invalidating model pointers after a load.
